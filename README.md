# Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) Game Starter Code 
Welcome to the CYOA Game Project! Fork this starter code to begin your quest.


### Project Requirements
Your project should:
- Include at least five screens with text related to your story on each.
- Start on a home screen that begins the story.
- Include at least two screens that offer players a choice between two options.
- Use p5play properties to style your button sprites.
- Apply nested conditionals, variables, and the `mouse.presses` method to code branching paths in your story.
- Create and call a function for each screen to keep your code organized.
- Optional:
  - Create a flowchart and storyboard to prototype your CYOA mod.
  - Mod the base game to make it your own by updating the game text and visuals to display your own story.


### Optional Spice Level + Extensions
You can extend your project further by:
- Trying a Spice Level Challenge (See Part 6)
- Making it accessible (See HQ for details)
- Adding more screens (See HQ for details)

## File Overview

### ← script.js

This is where we will add the JavaScript, p5.js, and p5.play code for our game.

### ← index.html

The HTML file contains HTML code that sets up a webpage for our game. We also add libraries in this file using HTML tags.

### ← README.md

That's this file. This is the place to tell people more about what your game does and how you built it. 

### ← style.css

The CSS file adds styling rules to your content like changing colors and fonts. We will not use this file for our game and instead update the style of our game in the script.js file.
